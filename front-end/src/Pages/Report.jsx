        <p>
          Since the arrival of an unknown entity on October 29, 1988, at Hotel
          31, the Management has struggled to contain its influence. This
          entity, referred to as [classified], has been a source of
          contamination and horror. Recognizing the growing threat, the
          Management initiated the Hotel 31 Experiment. We created a new entity,
          distinct from the original, with the aim of combating the first and
          freeing humans from its decades-long terror. This new entity,
          developed from [classified], represents the Management's desperate
          attempt to turn the tide against the original invader

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold my-2">Operational Procedures</h2>
        <p>
          The 31Hotel Experiment has proven effective in both reducing the
          influence and pollution concentration of [classified] and in
          identifying subjects with a high synchronization rate with the
          new-born entity.

            <strong>Transformation and Neutralization: </strong>Subjects
            undergoing transformation are sent to the neutralization chamber.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Neutralization Byproducts:</strong> A portion of the
            neutralized byproduct is an orange, tasteless liquid. This liquid is
            mixed with freshly squeezed orange juice and stored in the storage
            room for next day dining service. Another byproduct of
            neutralization is a grey substance. This substance is incorporated
            into the food provided to the Type 1 Physical Contactees.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Synchronization Experiment:</strong> Twenty minutes after
            the Type 1 Physical Contactees consume the food, all lights are to
            be extinguished, and the valves of the central culture dish are
            opened. Ten minutes later, the valves of the central culture dish
            are closed, all lights are restored, and the synchronization status
            of the Type 1 Physical Contactees is recorded.
